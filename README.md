## react2022

This repository is a playground where I test various bleeding-edge React libraries.

Currently: base is Vite3 + TS + React template.

Lots of good tips from https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

Libraries:

- React v18
- React Router v6 ([docs](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial))
- React Table v8
- React Hook Form v7.33
- React Query v4
