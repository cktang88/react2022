## react2022

This repository is a playground where I test various bleeding-edge React libraries.

Currently: base is Vite + TS + React template.

Lots of good tips from https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

Libraries:

- Vite v4
- TS v5 (beta)
- React v18
- React Router v6 ([docs](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial))
- tanstack Table v8
- React Hook Form v7
- tanstack Query v4

- [Vanilla-extract](https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract) - vite + TS support, zero runtime
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/components/accordion) - styleless components
